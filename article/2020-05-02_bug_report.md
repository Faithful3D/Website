<h3>Hi everyone!</h3>
<p align="justify">
	We are human like everyone who use Faithful 3D (Im not 100% sure about that btw), and like every human on earth, we make mistakes or bugs. That's why it's really important to report them to us...
</p>
<h3>Yeah, but how?</h3>
<p align="justify">
	Well, answer is simple, you just have to use following links and open an issue:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Juknum/Faithful-3D/issues">report bug for Faithful 3D <strong>Resource pack</strong></a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Juknum/faithful3d.github.io/issues">report bug for Faithful 3D <strong>Website</strong></a></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h3>Ok, but why GitHub?</h3>
<p>
	Just to avoid most of trolls and dupplicate report bug
