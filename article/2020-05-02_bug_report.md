	<h3>Hi everyone!</h3>
	<p align="justify">
		We are human like everyone who use Faithful 3D (Im not 100% sure about that btw), and like every human on earth, we make mistakes or bugs. That's why it's really important to report them to us...
	</p>

	<h3>Yeah, but where?</h3>
	<p align="justify">
		Well, answer is simple, you just have to use following links and open an issue:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Juknum/Faithful-3D/issues"><strong>Resource pack</strong> report bug</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Juknum/faithful3d.github.io/issues"><strong>Website</strong> report bug</a></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Ok, but why GitHub?</h3>
	<p align="justify">
		Just to avoid most of trolls and dupplicate report bug!
	</p>

	<h3>Well, but how?</h3>
	<p align="justify">
		Template! you can choose one <a href="https://github.com/Juknum/faithful3d.github.io/issues/new/choose">here</a> when you have to report a bug or make suggestion for the <strong>website</strong>. Otherwise you can follow this one below (if it concerns the resource pack):
	</p>
	<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-dark">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>About</th>
			<th>Title</th>
			<th>Label(s)</th>
			<th>Assignee(s)</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
