	<h3>Hi everyone!</h3>
	<p align="justify">
		We have added language support for the website!
    Faithful 3D and its community are growing day after day,
    and with the attendance of the website increasing.
    We decided to add language support to allow you to better understand and interact with us!
	</p>
	<p>
		But for now, we only have 3 languages available:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>EN</strong> - English</li>
			<li><strong>DE</strong> - Deutsch</li>
			<li><strong>FR</strong> - Fran√ßais</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you can speak a language fluently, contact us <a href="https://discord.gg/GJzgeY7">here (Discord)</a>!
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>PS: Besides if you speak English fluently, help us, because spelling and grammatical errors must be numerous...</i>
